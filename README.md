This is a straightforward code for exporting the `sessionid` from a user via a URL.

**Instructions:**

1. Provide the TikTok URL (e.g., `https://tiktok.com/t/ZMrbCH***`).
2. The user should open this URL on their phone.
3. The TikTok app will launch and request access.
4. If the user grants access, the Python code will print the `sessionid`.

I hope this code helps make your project the best it can be :)
